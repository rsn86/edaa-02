	abstract = {When sequential file structures must be used and binary searching is not feasible, jump searching becomes an appealing alternative. This paper explores variants of the classic jump searching scheme where the optimum jump size is the square root of the number of records. Multiple level and variable size jump strategies are explored, appropriate applications are discussed and performance is evaluated.},

	abstract = {Given a monotone ordered multi-dimensional real array A and a real value k, an important question in computation is to establish if k is a member of A by sequentially searching A by comparing k with some of its entries. This search problem and its known results are surveyed, including the case when A has sizes not necessarily equal. Worst case search algorithms for various types of arrays of finite dimension and sizes are reported. Each algorithm has order strictly less than the product of the sizes of the array. Present challenges and open problems in the area are also presented.},
